# summary of What you need to run it

- Python (tested on 2.6)
- GTK 2

**Note for Windows users :**

You need Python **and** PyGTK.
You can download both there:
- [Python](http://www.python.org/download/)
- GTK *(Sorry, the link I had is broken, but just google it you should be fine)*

Then, you also need 3 packages there: [http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html](http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html)

Look for the 3 : 

- PyGTK
- PyCairo
- PyGObject
