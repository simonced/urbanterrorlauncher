This project is an easy way to manage your list of Urban Terror servers you play the most, maintain friends lists and launch Urban Terror from the same GUI (you can also use 'Application' or 'Utility' here). The concept was simply to let you add a server name and address and have them displayed in a simple list that you can click and go to play.

It's growing and nice cool features are on the go, please go read the [Wiki](Presentation.md) for details, as for requirements.
